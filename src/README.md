## Background

This application is particularly useful to people associated in the process of hiring including but not restriced to Training and Placement Officers and the HR Managers.

Problem Statement: When working with a large CSV file with a list of links of resumes it can become a tedious task to manually open each link and inspect the same. 

Solution: Using the Resume Extractor you can extract all the resumes which were initially present in a csv file as links into pdf format. The program additionally converts the folder into a zip file so that it can be easily shared across the team.

## Install

This project uses [python](https://www.python.org/). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.
<!-- 
```sh
$ npm install --global standard-readme-spec
``` -->
Once you have python setup on your device, use the below commands to install the required libraries: 
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
OR
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main.py file using any IDE/terminal/shell.

```sh
python3 main.py
```
OR
```sh
python main.py
```
A dialog box appears from where you can select the .csv file on which the operation is to be performed. After that the program will execute and you will have your zip file in the ```out``` folder.

Also in case of any invalid or inaccessible links, you will have the list of those candidates on the console.
